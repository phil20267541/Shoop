      <h2>What is Shoop?</h2>
      <p>
        Shoop is a cozy little world built for collecting, customising, and caring for your own weirdly
        adorable creature — the Shoop. It started as a simple idea: what if there was a place online that
        felt like a warm mug of hot chocolate mixed with pixel-pet chaos?
      </p>
      <p>
        In Shoop, everything is designed to be small, colourful, and full of personality. Farm a Shoop.
        Name it. Dress it up in a hat that’s far too big. Give it a shiny theme or a questionable outfit
        combination. Watch its stats grow (or fall apart). It’s meant to be a playful escape — something
        that doesn’t take itself too seriously, but still feels crafted with care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every part of Shoop is built to be expanded later: more cosmetics, more customisation,
        more interactions, more little surprises. The goal is to make a world that keeps growing,
        just like its tiny potato-creatures.

      <h2>How Shoop Started</h2>
      <p>Shoop technically began as a joke — specifically, a message from one of my friends that said:</p>
      <blockquote>“If 1 teeth is A Tooth</blockquote>
      <blockquote>If 1 geese is A goose</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Doesn’t that mean that 1 sheep should be A Shoop?”</blockquote>
      <p>That was it. That was the spark.</p>
      <p>
        From that single chaotic sentence, the idea of “a Shoop” got stuck in my brain.
        It felt too funny and too perfect not to turn into something. So I opened VS Code,
        made a folder named “shoop”, and started building a world around this imaginary
        creature that shouldn’t exist but absolutely does now.
      </p>
      <p>Turns out, one joke message was the beginning of an entire project.</p>

      <h2>About the Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Hey — I’m Phillip. I started Shoop partly as a coding challenge, partly as a “this would be fun, right?”
        idea, and partly because every project I’ve made so far has been missing one thing:
        a funny little creature wearing boots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoop is where I get to experiment, learn, try new frameworks, build systems, break systems, fix systems,
        and generally just level up as a developer. The project mixes front-end work, UI design, Vue routing,
        custom components, asset handling, and all the weird little problems that come with making your own mini-game.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s also a way for me to build something that feels personal — a place where I can use creativity and code
        at the same time. Shoop isn’t finished (and probably never will be), but that’s part of the fun.
        It’s a growing project made by someone who likes exploring new ideas, improving old ones,
        and occasionally giving a small digital creature a ridiculous hat.
